My name is Jeet Nair, I am a student at DMACC planning on transferring courses over to Iowa State University. I am 20 years old and am pursuing a Software Engineering and Computer Science Major. My plans for the future are to hopefully get a career in game design and eventually design a game of my own one day.  I have one younger sibling along with my mom and dad back home in Illinois. I enjoy coding in all sorts of languages such as Java, C++, C#, Python, and am always looking to learn more languages.
